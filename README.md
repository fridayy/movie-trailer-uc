To generate the movie trailer html site run main.py with python3.
## Run
```
$ python3 main.py
```

Then you will find the generated HTML file: fresh_tomatoes.html in the movie-trailer directory.

This will generate a list of movies with some additional information gathered from
the open movie database api (http://www.omdbapi.com/).
omdbapi is an awesome project, if you like it please consider that they accept donations!
